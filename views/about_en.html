			    <h1>Why Beego?</h1>
			    <p>
			    	I used to use CI in PHP and tornado in Python, there are both lightweight, so they has following advantages:
			    	<ul>
			    		<li>Save time for handling general problems, I only need to care about logic part.</li>
			    		<li>Learn more about languages by studying their source code, it's not hard to read and understand them because they are both lightweight frameworks.</li>
			    		<li>It's quite easy to make secondary development of these frameworks for specific purposes.</li>
			    	</ul>
					Those reasons are my original intention of implementing Beego, and used two chapters in my book to introduce and design this lightweight web framework in Go. <a href="https://github.com/astaxie/beego/blob/master/docs/en/Why.md">read more -&gt;</a>

			            The <a href="http://gowalker.org/net/http">Go HTTP server</a>
			            runs each request in its own

			          <h2>Stateless</h2>
			          <p>
			            Revel provides primitives that keep the web tier stateless for
			            predictable scaling. For example, session data is stored in the user
			            cookie, and the cache is backed by a memcached cluster.
			          </p>

			        <div class="span4">
			          <h2>Modular</h2>
			          <p>
			            Revel is built around composable middleware called <b>filters</b>,
			            which implement nearly all request-processing
			            functionality. Developers have the freedom to replace the default
			            filters with custom implementations (e.g. a custom router).

			    <h1>Features</h1>
			    <p>
			    	beego is an open-source, high-performance web framework for the Go programming language. This web framework has been already used for building web servers and tools in SNDA's CDN system.
